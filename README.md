Why Namami Gange?
Understanding the urgency behind our mission

The Ganga is not just a river; it's a lifeline that sustains over 400 million people across the northern Indian plains. For centuries, it has been the center of social and religious traditions, providing water for drinking, agriculture, and industry.

However, rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and agricultural intensification have placed enormous pressure on this vital resource. Pollution levels have reached alarming levels in many stretches of the river, threatening both ecosystem health and human wellbeing.

Our AI-powered water quality monitoring platform was born from the urgent need to track, understand, and predict water quality parameters along the entire length of the Ganga. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we aim to provide actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and citizens.
